# GitHub account

> GitHub is a website that is used by developers to save and archive codebase. It's also really useful for collaborating on projects with teammates. As an example, if you want to see the bitcoin codebase, it's on GitHub on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin

You have to create a GitHub account. If you already have one, that's okay, otherwise, **[sign up right away](https://github.com/join).**

⚠️ **[Upload a picture](https://github.com/settings/profile)** and put your name correctly on your GitHub account. This is really important as we'll reuse your profile picture for avatars in Kitt, which is Le Wagon learning platform. Please do it **now**.
