# Sublime Text 3 - Your text editor

> A text editor is a software like word that is used by developers to write code. Since code is just text, then the old "Notepad" text editor from our old windows was enough to write code. But we prefer more complete tools with shortcuts to navigate between files, to add code colorization, etc. A text editor is one of the most important tools of a developer.

We'll install sublime text 3. Go to [this page](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) and download **Sublime Text 3** for OS X. Install it (double click the downloaded file and drag & drop the app **into** the `Applications` folder, **don't skip this**).

⚠️ If you had Sublime Text 2 installed before, please uninstall it (by dragging/dropping it to the Trash).

Sublime Text is free without any time limitation but a popup will appear every ten saves to remind you there is a license to buy. You can hit `Esc` when this happens, but feel free to buy Sublime Text if you really like this one.

Again, make sure that Sublime Text is there, not in the disk image you downloaded. To make sure it's correct, once Sublime Text is installed, unmount the "Sublime Text 3" disk in the left panel of Finder. Finder will complain if something went wrong. Ask a teacher.

There also free alternatives to sublime. The most famous ones are :
* Atom (developped by GitHub)
* VSCode (developped by MicroSoft)
* Vim (which is really old, really complicated to learn but really powerful once mastered)
