## Hello ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to your new big journey ! We're really happy to have you here ðŸ˜Š

Today is a special day at Le Wagon, you'll have to setup your computer, and install a lot of tools and technologies that we'll use for the next 9 weeks.

Here is the big picture of what we'll do today :
  - Install a text editor, like word, but dedicated to code
  - Install a package manager, like an appstore, but targeted to developers
  - Install a custom terminal, more powerful that the default one
  - Install git and setup GitHub, that will help us to save our code and collaborate with teammates
  - Install ruby ðŸ’ª
  - Register on the kitt platform as an alumni of Le Wagon
  - Register on slack channels of Le Wagon

Then you'll have all the tools to start your journey ðŸš€
